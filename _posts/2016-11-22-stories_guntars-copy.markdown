How to plan your time efficiently to succeed?


Working besides studying requires successful time management in order to succeed at both places simultaneously. Having a planner in your pocket and scheduling the activities helps to manage and understand where your precious moments are heading; however, one needs to estimate the time for each activity and to schedule time for interruptions.


Gather your thoughts every day to decide what are your goals and what exactly you want to achieve from each activity. Prepare for them beforehand. After examining the goals, prioritization should be done even you think that it is possible to get everything done.


Learn to say NO, not only to home assignments or tasks at work, but also to your friends, Facebook, and Your smartphone, if that distracts you from your goal. Moreover, the ”Do not Disturb” sign on Skype, turing off Your phone, or not looking at your e-mail whenever something new appears can be beneficial.
