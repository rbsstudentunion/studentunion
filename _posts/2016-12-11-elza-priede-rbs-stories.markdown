How to stay positive during a stress-filled week of studies?

"Build resilience and develop agility;

Assess value, prioritize;

Notice opportunities;

Attract good energy;

Never back down;

At all times be kind.

= 

Have control over your life;

Always make room for what makes you happy;

Please smile more and laugh often;

Practice 5P's: Prior Planning Prevents Poor Performance.

Yearn for more,

Feed your brain,

Rest well,

Use your brain,

Invest in yourself,

Train your brain."

-Elza Priede,

Bachelor Program Coordinator
